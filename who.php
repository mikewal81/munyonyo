                        <p>Munyonyo Parish Choir, Kampala, has been in service at Christ the King Parish since 1936. At the time of inception,
                            the Choir Director was Mr. S. Lobo assisted by Choirmaster, Mr. Remy de Silva. The Choir mainly comprised of the Goan
                            community with only four Ugandan members, one of whom was the late Valerian Mayega.</p>

                        <p>In 1961, a good number of choir members including the Choirmaster and Director, left the country leaving Ugandans to take
                            up the task of re-building the Choir. Mr. A.D. Lubowa became the Conductor of the Choir with late Valerian Mayega as his
                            assistant. Late Mr. Mayega served as Music Director and Chief Organist until he died in 1991 while Mr. AD Lubowa retired
                            as Conductor in 1995.</p>

                        <p>Prior to his death, Mr. Mayega had groomed a younger conductor, Mr. Mberenge Patrick, who worked closely with him and later
                            took over as Music Director. Mr. Mberenge served as Music Director from 1991 to 2008. Currently, he is the music Technical
                            Advisor of the Choir. Mr. Mberenge handed the mantle of Director to Mr. Sekyewa Louis, who served until 2016. The Choir is now
                            ably directed and instructed by Mr. Mugesera Dominic with Mr. Dennis Miiro, as assistant organist. The Choir is endowed with many
                            musically talented young men and women who assist the Music Director from time to time.</p>

                        <p>Past Chairpersons who have contributed to the continuous existence and sustainable service of Munyonyo Parish Choir include
                            the late Mathias Lutaaya, Salongo Muyingo Mr. Masembe Godfrey, Mr. Kiriggwajjo Anatooli, Mrs. Ssenkubuge Agnes, Mrs. Ssentoogo Warugaba Mildred,
                            and the current Chairman being Mr. Nsiimoomwe Felix.</p>

                        <p>Special mention is inevitable of the services rendered to the Choir by Mr. Luggya Paul, as Organist and Mr. Sengendo Zake D. Andrew as Instructor and Conductor.
                            The two musicians are members of the Choir whose contribution has seen the Choir grow to greater heights through their love for music and selfless service to God.
                            In the same breath, the choir has enjoyed singing songs written by Cosma Warugaba, late Valerian Mayega, Benedict Mubangizi, Rev. Fr. Charles Kabuye,
                            Rev. Fr. Dr. Okello, Micheal Mukisa and Eng. Wassanyi Sserukenya, and Tony Muyingo. as well as music from other parts of the world but mostly Classical
                            music by famous composers such as Bach, Mozart, Handel, Mendelsson, Stainer and Hayden.</p>
